    <h2>Overview and Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to understand how fight songs differ across schools and across time by comparing their structure,
      language, and rhythm. This project includes two visualizations. One focuses on musical composition. The
      other focuses on language use over time.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      Data source: FiveThirtyEight Fight Songs dataset. This entry focuses on Big Ten institutions.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <h3>How to read the main visualization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each school is one slice of the circle, ordered by tempo (BPM).</li>
        <li>Color shows the factor: Identity (blue), Chantiness (gray), Aggressiveness (black).</li>
        <li>Spoke length shows level: inner ring is absent, middle ring is noticeable, outer ring is dominant.</li>
        <li>Inner squiggles encode tempo groups using Italian tempo terms.</li>
        <li>Hover over any spoke to see the full university name, song title, and BPM.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Fight Song Composition</h2>
    <p>
      This interactive volvelle-style visualization compares Big Ten fight songs across three compositional factors:
      Identity, Chantiness, and Aggressiveness.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      Note: “Chantiness” is a term I use to describe how easy a song is to chant in a crowd.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      The volvelle makes it easy to compare patterns across schools without ranking them. It shows that fight songs
      can signal school spirit in different ways. Some songs rely more on identity and chant structure. Others use
      more confrontational language. Tempo adds another layer. Faster songs often feel more energetic, but speed does
      not always match lyrical aggression.
    </p>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>The Word “Fight” Over Time</h2>
    <p>
      The second visualization looks at language use over time. It focuses on how often fight songs use the word
      “fight,” and how this changes across years.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      <h3>How to read the second visualization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each point is one song.</li>
        <li>The x-axis is year.</li>
        <li>Point size shows how many times the word “fight” appears in the lyrics.</li>
        <li>Color shows whether usage is absent, noticeable, or dominant.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- SECOND VIZ -->
    <iframe src="viz2.html" title="Fight word mentions over time"></iframe>

    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      The timeline view adds context to the compositional comparison. It shows that explicit use of the word “fight”
      is not constant across eras. Some periods use direct language more often, while others lean more on identity
      and tradition without repeating the word itself.
